Transactional Data Processing::

	Request/Confirmation: 
		It assumes that a Web service request is sent from another application to a SAP application. 
		The confirmation of the execution of the Web service is returned either immediately (synchronously) or later (asynchronously).

	Notification: 
		The other application sends a notification message to the SAP application. 
		This message leads to data changes. 
		In contrast to the request/confirmation pattern, no response is sent.

Data Retrieval and Information Syndication::

	Query/Response: 
		Another application requests some data from a SAP application in a `read-only` form, specified by a query. 
		Query/response communication can be either synchronous or asynchronous.

	Information:
		The difference to the notification pattern is that the information message is typically sent to a list of subscribed receivers, 
			and the receivers do not take immediate action upon the information received. 
		No response to the information message is expected.
