	Communication means transferring messages from one to another and it has several forms such as intrapersonal, interpersonal, group and mass communication. While it comes to group communication it has a certain patterns in its own.Few patterns are popular in mainstream communication studies. Such as Circle, Chain, Y and Wheel

Circle Pattern
==============

.. note:: In circle pattern there is a leader and all group member are in a hierarchy. The leader can communicate with the group member who presents net to him/her. The leader can not talk to the members who are lowest in the hierarchy.

All group members can communicate with the leader through the members who present above and below that person. The message flows in a single direction. It is not possible for the group members to communicate directly with the leader in circle communication pattern which is also a disadvantage of this pattern. They can only communicate with the leader through other group members senior to them.




Chain Pattern
=============

.. note:: Chain pattern appears like a circle pattern it also follows few chains of command. In this pattern last person receives the message from the leader. It is a one-way flow communication.

In chain communication all members did not get the opportunity to talk to the leader directly so they might receive modified lecture of the leader. Thre is no feedback to identify message distortion. A leader does not know wheather last member receives the message or not.





Y Pattern
=========

.. note:: The group is separated into three and the group members can communicate with the leader only. This pattern is little complicated as three different groups are situated into one single group. According to Levitt these three groups are controlled by a single leader. There are three members in each subgroup.

There is a chain of command in the subgroup. The lowest level member of each subgroup communicates with the members senior to them. Members communicate with their senior member of each group and that senior member communicate to the leader directly.

Wheel pattern
=============

In this pattern team leader stands in the middle and all other members stand at the same level of the structure. This pattern is one of the best patterns while comparing to the other three. Here all member can communicate with the leader directly. One disadvantage of this group is members can not talk to each other and sometimes it happened other members even do not know who is the other member presents at his/her same level.

Communication problems are less in this pattern and method is really quick. No distortion of information by other members of the group while passing the message.
