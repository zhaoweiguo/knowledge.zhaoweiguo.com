* Sphinx makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.(用于生成智能化和美观文档的工具)
* Sphinx uses the reStructuredText markup language by default, and can read MyST markdown via third-party extensions. Both of these are powerful and straightforward to use, and have functionality for complex documentation and publishing workflows. They both build upon Docutils to parse and write documents.


Here are some of Sphinx’s major features::

   Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help), LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text
   Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
   Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children
   Automatic indices: general index as well as a language-specific module indices
   Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
   Extensions: automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings from Python modules (API docs) via built-in extensions, and much more functionality via third-party extensions.
   Themes: modify the look and feel of outputs via creating themes, and re-use many third-party themes.
   Contributed extensions: dozens of extensions contributed by users; most of them installable from PyPI.
