Dataset distillation
====================

* Dataset distillation is a technique designed to condense large datasets into smaller, synthetic versions that maintain the essential information needed for training models, thereby reducing computational costs and complexity. This process is particularly beneficial in scenarios where data storage and processing resources are limited. The method can be approached through various strategies, each with its own advantages and challenges.
