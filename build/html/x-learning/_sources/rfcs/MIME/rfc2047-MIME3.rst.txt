RFC2047: (MIME) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text
########################################################################

* Obsoletes: `rfc1521`, `rfc1522`, `rfc1590`
* Updated by: `rfc2184`, `rfc2231`
* Category: Standards Track
* November 1996



1. Introduction
===============

* Generally, an ``"encoded-word"`` is a sequence of printable ASCII characters that begins with "=?", ends with "?=", and has two "?"s in between.  It specifies a character set and an encoding method, and also includes the original text encoded as graphic ASCII characters, according to the rules for that encoding method.
* A mail composer that implements this specification will provide a means of inputting non-ASCII text in header fields, but will translate these fields (or appropriate portions of these fields) into encoded-words before inserting them into the message header.
* A mail reader that implements this specification will recognize encoded-words when they appear in certain portions of the message header. Instead of displaying the encoded-word "as is", it will reverse the encoding and display the original text in the designated character set.
* This memo relies heavily on notation and terms defined RFC 822 and RFC 2045.

2. Syntax of encoded-words
==========================

::

   encoded-word = "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="

   charset = token    ; see section 3

   encoding = token   ; see section 4

   token = 1*<Any CHAR except SPACE, CTLs, and especials>

   especials = "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" / "@" / "," / ";" / ":" / "
               <"> / "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" / "." / "="

   encoded-text = 1*<Any printable ASCII character other than "?" or SPACE>
                  ; (but see "Use of encoded-words in message headers", section 5)


* An 'encoded-word' may not be more than 75 characters long, including 'charset', 'encoding', 'encoded-text', and delimiters.
* If it is desirable to encode more text than will fit in an 'encoded-word' of 75 characters, multiple 'encoded-word's (separated by CRLF SPACE) may be used.


* 'encoded-word's are designed to be recognized as 'atom's by an RFC 822 parser.  
* As a consequence, unencoded white space characters (such as SPACE and HTAB) are FORBIDDEN within an 'encoded-word'.

示例::

	错误的示例:
		=?iso-8859-1?q?this is some text?=

	would be parsed as four 'atom's, rather than as a single 'atom' (by an RFC 822 parser) 
		or 'encoded-word' (by a parser which understands 'encoded-words').

    正确的示例:
	    =?iso-8859-1?q?this=20is=20some=20text?=
    解析结果:
    	"this is some text" in the ISO-8859-1 character set.
    说明:
    	q: indicates that the quoted-printable encoding method is used



3. Character sets
=================

* The 'charset' portion of an 'encoded-word' specifies the character set associated with the unencoded text.
* Some character sets use code-switching techniques to switch between "ASCII mode" and other modes.


4. Encodings
============

* Initially, the legal values for "encoding" are "Q" and "B".
* The "B" encoding is identical to the "BASE64" encoding defined by RFC 2045.
* The "Q" encoding is similar to the "Quoted-Printable" content-transfer-encoding defined in RFC 2045.


5. Use of encoded-words in message headers
==========================================

* 【定义】Encoded-Word是一种在电子邮件中用于表示非ASCII字符的方式。它使用一种特殊的编码格式将非ASCII字符转换成ASCII字符，以便在电子邮件中传输和显示。
* Encoded-Word可以在电子邮件的头部和正文部分的某些特定位置出现，例如主题、发送者和接收者名称等位置。
* Encoded-Word是电子邮件国际化的关键技术之一，可以让电子邮件支持不同语言的字符集。
* Encoded-Word的格式::

	=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=
	说明:
		charset表示字符集，
		encoding表示编码格式，
		encoded-text表示经过编码后的文本
	常用的编码格式有:
		Quoted-Printable
		Base64


6. Support of 'encoded-word's by mail readers
=============================================

* A mail reader must parse the message and body part headers according to the rules in RFC 822 to correctly recognize ``'encoded-word's``.



7. Conformance
==============

* 以 "=?" 开头并以 "?=" 结尾的非空格可打印 ASCII 字符串都是一个有效的 'encoded-word'



8. Examples
===========

示例::

   From: =?US-ASCII?Q?Keith_Moorex<moore@cs.utk.edu>
   To: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= <keld@dkuug.dk>
   CC: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Andr=E9?= Pirard <PIRARD@vm1.ulg.ac.be>
   Subject: =?ISO-8859-1?B?SWYgeW91IGNhbiByZWFkIHRoaXMgeW8=?=
    =?ISO-8859-2?B?dSB1bmRlcnN0YW5kIHRoZSBleGFtcGxlLg==?=
