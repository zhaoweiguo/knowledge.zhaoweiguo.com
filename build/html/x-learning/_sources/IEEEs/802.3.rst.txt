IEEE 802.3
##########


* IEEE 802.3 is a working group and a collection standards defining the physical layer and data link layer's media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet.
* 802.3 is a technology that supports the IEEE 802.1 network architecture.






Ethernet II
===========

* Ethernet II framing (also known as DIX Ethernet, named after DEC, Intel and Xerox, the major participants in its design[8])
* Ethernet II已成为事实标准，统一由新的 IEEE 802.3 standard维护
* In order to allow some frames using Ethernet II framing: 
  1. If EtherType values is greater than or equal to 1536(0x0600), the frame must be an Ethernet II frame; 
  2. If EtherType values is less than or equal to 1500(0x05DC), it must be an IEEE 802.3 frame; 
  3. Values between 1500 and 1536, exclusive, are undefined.
