2020-07-08: Google成立OUC
-------------------------
  

* One of the places we’ve historically seen projects stumble is in managing their trademarks – their project's name and logo … today we are announcing the Open Usage Commons (OUC), an organization focused on extending the philosophy and definition of open source to project trademarks.”
* The new org has had some initial funding from Google, and has three sets of trademarks to look after for starters: those of Angular (a Typescript web framework), Gerrit (a code-collaboration tool) and Istio (a service mesh for Kubernetes).
