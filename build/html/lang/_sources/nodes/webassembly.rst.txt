It can have some performance issues when we are talking about more intensive use, like 3D games, computer vision, and image editing. WebAssembly is meant to solve this problem.

WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

It means you can compile a code written in C or Rust, for example, and execute it on the browser, at near-native speed.
