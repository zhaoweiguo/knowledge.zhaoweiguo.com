安装::

    pip install wheel



生成whl文件
===========



Converting Eggs to Wheels::

    # It works on both .egg files and .egg directories, 
    # and you can convert multiple eggs with a single command:
    $ wheel convert blah-1.2.3-py2.7.egg foo-2.0b1-py3.5.egg


使用whl文件安装应用
===================

Usage::

    $ pip install someproject-1.5.0-py2-py3-none.whl



常用命令
========


wheel convert
-------------

* Convert one or more eggs (.egg; made with bdist_egg) or Windows installers (.exe; made with bdist_wininst) into wheels.
* Egg names must match the standard format::

    <project>-<version>-pyX.Y for pure Python wheels
    <project>-<version>-pyX.Y-<arch> for binary wheels



::

    $ wheel convert foobar-1.2.3-py2.7.egg
    $ ls *.whl
    foobar-1.2.3-py27-none.whl


wheel unpack
------------

* Unpack the given wheel file.
* This is the equivalent of unzip <wheel_file>, except that it also checks that the hashes and file sizes match with those in RECORD and exits with an error if it encounters a mismatch.



::

    $ wheel unpack someproject-1.5.0-py2-py3-none.whl
    Unpacking to: ./someproject-1.5.0


wheel pack
----------

* Repack a previously unpacked wheel file.
* This command can be used to repack a wheel file after its contents have been modified. This is the equivalent of zip -r <wheel_file> <wheel_directory> except that it regenerates the RECORD file which contains hashes of all included files.

::

    $ wheel unpack someproject-1.5.0-py2-py3-none.whl
    Unpacking to: ./someproject-1.5.0
    $ touch someproject-1.5.0/somepackage/module.py
    $ wheel pack --build-number 2 someproject-1.5.0
    Repacking wheel as ./someproject-1.5.0-2-py2-py3-none.whl...OK


wheel tags
----------

* Make a new wheel with given tags from and existing wheel.
* Any tags left unspecified will remain the same. Multiple tags are separated by a “.” Starting with a “+” will append to the existing tags. Starting with a “-” will remove a tag. Be sure to use the equals syntax on the shell so that it does not get parsed as an extra option, such as --python-tag=-py2. The original file will remain unless --remove is given. The output filename(s) will be displayed on stdout for further processing.

::

    $ wheel tags --python-tag=py2.py3 --abi-tag=none cmake-3.20.2-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
    cmake-3.20.2-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl
