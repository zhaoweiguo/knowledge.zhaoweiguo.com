MANIFEST.in
###########

* A MANIFEST.in is needed when you need to package additional files that are not automatically included in a source distribution.



.. note:: However, you may not have to use a MANIFEST.in. For an example, the PyPA sample project has removed its manifest file, since all the necessary files have been included by Setuptools 43.0.0 and newer.

.. note:: MANIFEST.in does not affect binary distributions such as wheels.
