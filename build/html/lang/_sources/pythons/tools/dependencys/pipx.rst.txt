.. note:: pipx only works with Python 3.6+.



* pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python. It's roughly similar to macOS's ``brew``, JavaScript's ``npx``, and Linux's ``apt``.
* It's closely related to pip. In fact, it uses pip, but is focused on installing and managing Python packages that can be run from the command line directly as applications.

* [How is it Different from pip?] -> pip is a general-purpose package installer for both libraries and apps with no environment isolation. pipx is made specifically for application installation, as it adds isolation yet still makes the apps available in your shell: pipx creates an isolated environment for each application and its associated packages.





.. warning:: It is not recommended to install pipx via pipx. If you'd like to do this anyway, take a look at the pipx-in-pipx project and read about the limitations there.
