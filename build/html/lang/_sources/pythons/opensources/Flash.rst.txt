Flask-SocketIO::

    Flask-SocketIO gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional

    The client-side application can use any of the SocketIO official clients libraries 
      in Javascript, C++, Java and Swift, or any compatible client 
      to establish a permanent connection to the server.
