2016年，CoreOS在Kubernetes中引入了Operator这一概念。CoreOS首席技术官布兰登-飞利浦(Brandon Philips)在其开创性blog`Introducing Operators: Putting Operational Knowledge into Software
 <https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html>`_ 中将Operator定义为::

    A Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) is a person [who] operates an application by writing software. 
    They are an engineer, a developer, who knows how to develop software specifically 
        for a particular application domain. 
    The resulting piece of software has an application’s operational domain knowledge programmed into it.
    [...]
    We call this new class of software Operators. 
    An Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API 
        to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications 
        on behalf of a Kubernetes user. 
    It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts 
        but includes domain or application-specific knowledge to automate common tasks.
