Network modes
=============

* 【参考】Network modes in Parallels Desktop for Mac: https://kb.parallels.com/4948



Shared Networking
-----------------

::

    Parallels Desktop creates a separate virtual subnet with its own virtual DHCP server running in macOS.
    A virtual machine belongs to that virtual subnet with its own IP range.
    A virtual machine is not visible in the real subnet the Mac belongs to.
    A virtual machine use full Internet access.
    If Mac is connected to virtual private network - VPN access is automatically shared with virtual machine.



Bridged Network
---------------

When this network mode is used, your virtual machine uses a virtualized network interface card with direct access to Internet. As a result::

    A virtual machine appears as a separate computer that belongs to the same subnet as the Mac it is running on.
    A DHCP server (e.g., your router) provides a virtual machine with an IP address within the same IP range as other computers in the same subnet.
    A virtual machine can ping and see all computers in the subnet. 
    Other computers can ping and see the virtual machine.

    在桥接模式下，虚拟机和宿主机之间的network interfaces是一一对应的。



Host-Only Network
-----------------

* This mode is similar to Shared Network except that this virtual subnet (10.37.129.x) is isolated from the outer world. As a result, the virtual machine that is working in host-only mode can only see and ping other virtual machines and communicate with the gateway (10.37.129.1).


Enabling port forwarding
========================

    可以把本地的2222端口映射到vm对应的22端口，实现vm的ssh登录
