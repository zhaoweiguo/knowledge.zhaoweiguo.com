参数
====


* --build: Builds any images specified in the Docker Compose file before starting them. This can be skipped if the images already exist and their versions match those specified in the Compose file.
* --attach-dependencies: Attaches containers started by dependencies to the current container's output stream so that they can be viewed while the parent container is running.
* Overall, this command is used to initialize a new Docker environment based on a Docker Compose configuration file, build any necessary images, and then start the associated containers. The attach-dependencies flag allows you to view logs generated by dependent services within the same console window.
