===================

Metrics, Monitoring
-------------------

See List of metrics for all metrics per release.

Note that any etcd_debugging_* metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Add etcd_cluster_version Prometheus metric.
* Add etcd_debugging_mvcc_total_put_size_in_bytes Prometheus metric.

etcdserver
----------

Fix `wait purge file loop during shutdown. <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11308>`_::

    Previously, during shutdown etcd could accidentally remove needed wal files, 
        resulting in catastrophic error 「etcdserver: open wal error: wal: file not found.」 during startup.
    Now, etcd makes sure the purge file loop exits before server signals stop of the raft node.
