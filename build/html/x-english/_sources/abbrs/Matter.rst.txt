* Information Element: A Wi-Fi (IEEE802.11-2020) data container used to convey various information regarding a particular Wi-Fi network’s capabilities and operation.
* Key Center: A system component which takes the NOCSR from a Commissioner and allocates an Operational Node ID that is unique to the Fabric, inserts this Operational Node ID as the DN into the NOC, and signs the NOC.
* Manual Pairing Code: An 11-digit or 21-digit numeric code that can be manually entered/spoken instead of scanning a QR code, which contains the information needed to commission a Matter device.
* Network: A set of nodes that have addressability, connectivity, and reachability to one another via Internet Protocol.
* Node: An addressable entity which supports the Matter protocol stack and (once Commissioned) has its own Operational Node ID and Node Operational credentials. A Device MAY host multiple Nodes.

* QR Code: A machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached.
* Role: Some set of (related) behaviors of a Node. Each Node can have multiple roles.
* Router: A device that provides routing services in its network in cooperation with other Routers.
* Soft-AP: A device utilizing Wi-Fi (IEEE802.11-2020) Access Point (AP) functionality to advertise its presence and allow IP-bearing connections but does not offer Internet connectivity.
* Secure Channel: A channel in which messages are encrypted and authenticated. Unicast secure channels also provide authentication of each peer.
* Server: A Cluster interface that typically supports all or most of the attributes of the Cluster. A Server Cluster communicates with a corresponding remote Client Cluster with the same Cluster identifier.
* Service Discovery: The ability of a Node to locate services of interest.
* Software Image: A data blob, equivalent to a file, utilized by a Node to update its software. For the purposes of OTA Software Update, this further refers to files conforming to the OTA Software Image File Format.
* Thread: A low-power IEEE 802.15.4-based IPv6 mesh networking technology.
