    cafile /etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates/ca.crt
    certfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.crt
    keyfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.key
    # require_certificate true
    use_identity_as_username true




require_certificate::

    1. false
        the SSL/TLS component of the client will verify the server 
        but there is no requirement for the client to provide anything for the server: 
          authentication is limited to the MQTT built in username/password. 
    2. true
        the client must provide a valid certificate in order to connect successfully. 


use_identity_as_username::

    1. true:
      It causes the Common Name (CN) from the client certificate to be used 
        instead of the MQTT username for access control purposes. 
      The password is not used because it is assumed that only authenticated clients have valid certificates. 
      This means that any CA certificates you include in cafile are valid for connecting to your broker. 
    2. false:
      the client must authenticate as normal (if required by password_file) through the MQTT options. 


use_subject_as_username::

    The same principle applies for the use_subject_as_username option, 
      but the entire certificate subject is used as the username instead of just the CN.
