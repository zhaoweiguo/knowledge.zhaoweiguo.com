SOLID Principles
################

* SOLID principles of object-oriented programming::
  
    SRP
    OCP
    LSP
    ISP
    DIP

SOLID 原则::

    1. SRP 单一职责原则
    2. OCP 开闭原则
    3. LSP 里式替换原则
    4. ISP 接口隔离原则
    5. DIP 依赖倒置原则

The SOLID concepts are::

    1. SRP: The Single-responsibility principle: 
      "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."
      In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
    
    2. OCP: The Open–closed principle: 
       "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
    
    3. LSP: The Liskov substitution principle: 
      "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to 
        use objects of derived classes without knowing it".
      See also design by contract.
    
    4. ISP: The Interface segregation principle: 
      "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
    
    5. DIP: The Dependency inversion principle: 
       "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
